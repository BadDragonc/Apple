# Apple
Goofy bot for Discord... The goal is to make it practically capable of everything.

# Open Source... To an extent.
This bot is generally for anyone, I mean it's not useful in the slightest but rather just a piece of art. It's designed to be annoying alongside having fun commands to play around with. Some things will -
not be open source such as future implementing of NLP and of course the key to the bot... We are working on imrpoving the bot in beneficial and useless matters.

# Why was this bot made?

>I'm bored and I like apples.
this quote, is from the bot developer, formerlyvia. <--- (their Discord) As quoted, they were pretty much bored. I am just a contributor to this project since I have more extent knowledge of coding than Via.

# Functionality
This bot is extremely limited right now. There will be more features coming soon, and much more things for this bot. If you'd like to add it to your server, here's a link --->
